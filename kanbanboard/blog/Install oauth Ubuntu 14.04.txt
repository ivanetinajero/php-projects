Tested un Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Before installing the OAuth make sure your apt-get is updated properly ?  else try to run those command which will update the apt-get also install the PECL support	
	$ sudo apt-get update 
	$ sudo apt-get install php-pear php5-dev

After that you need to run pecl install command for Oauth
	$ sudo pecl install oauth

After that add oauth entry in "/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini" file
	extension=oauth.so

Final and most important step restart your apache
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Error
Missing pcre.h when installing pecl_oauthsudo 
I was playing with pecl_oauth last week (more about that in a later post) and when I tried to install from PECL, it grabbed the files, ran the configure 
step but stopped with an error status during make. This is bad news for those of us who are ubuntu users rather than compile-happy linux users! 
Closer inspection showed this line around the point things started to go wrong:
	Error: /usr/include/php5/ext/pcre/php_pcre.h:29:18: error: pcre.h: No such file or directory

I didn't have the header files for pcre installed - in ubuntu the headers are in the -dev packages so I just installed what I needed:
	$ sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev

Enable oauth in CLI
1. Add oauth extension in "/etc/php5/cli/php.ini" file
	extension=oauth.so

2. Restart Apache2.

That's all
